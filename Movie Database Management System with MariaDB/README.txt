Progam description:  
The program modifies the movie management system to work with a relational database system. This program connects to MariaDB database and performs queries. The appropriate SQL statements are sent to and executed on the database. Depending on the query being performed, the proper method is used. The retrieved records are displayed to the user. All exceptions that occur because of queries are handled properly. Movies are retrieved and persisted to the database on-demand.

The Madjen's Movie Management System uses the MariaDB driver methods to 
1. Create a new record representing a movie
2. Retrieve records with movies released in a specific year
3. Retrieve records with a list of random movies
4. Delete a movie using its ID 
	
How to run:
