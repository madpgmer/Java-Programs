Progam description:  
This program implements abstract data type for a linlked list using the LinkedListADT interface methods. In this program an Singly Linked List class has been created that implements the LinkedListADT interface methods that has been coded by our team. In addition to this, a Node class has also been created that respresents a node in the linked list. 

Appending and Prepending items at the end and begining of the linked list accordingly are couple of functionalities implemented in the interface. The interface also contains other functionalities like 
- Inserting an item at a specific index in the linked list.
- Replacing an item in the linked list.
- Getting an item at an index in the linked list.
- Getting the index of an item in the linked list.
- Checking if linked list has an item.
- Clearing all items in the linked list.
- Getting the number of items in the linked list.
- Removing an item at an index in the linked list.

The program also performs JUnit testing on the implemented linked list and Serialization tests are also conducted to test for object serialization of the SLL class.
	
How to run:
This program is executable by right clicking LinkedListTests.java that is located in the tests package in the test folder and selecting 'Run As -> JUnit Test'. You can see the test results in a seperate tab. Do the same with SerializationTests.java to check the test results.
